        "reannotated_assistant_content": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of (x - 1)^4 multiplied by (1 + 1/x)^4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have expressions raised to a power, like (a + b)^n, you can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the constant term in the expansion of the product of two binomials. That means I need to consider both expansions and then find the term where the powers of x cancel out, leaving just a constant.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions separately:\n\n1. (x - 1)^4\n2. (1 + 1/x)^4\n\nI think I should expand both of these separately first and then multiply them together, but that might be too cumbersome. Maybe there's a smarter way to find just the constant term without expanding everything.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply the two expressions first before expanding. Let me see:\n\n(x - 1)^4 * (1 + 1/x)^4\n\nHmm, maybe I can combine these two expressions into a single binomial expression. Let's try multiplying (x - 1) and (1 + 1/x) first:\n\n(x - 1)(1 + 1/x) = x*(1) + x*(1/x) - 1*(1) - 1*(1/x) = x + 1 - 1 - 1/x = x - 1/x\n\nOh, that's nice! So, (x - 1)(1 + 1/x) simplifies to x - 1/x. Therefore, the original expression becomes:\n\n(x - 1/x)^4\n\nNow, I just need to find the constant term in the expansion of (x - 1/x)^4.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, (a + b)^n = sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. In this case, a is x, b is -1/x, and n is 4.\n\nSo, the expansion will be:\n\nsum from k=0 to 4 of (4 choose k) * x^(4 - k) * (-1/x)^k\n\nLet me write out each term:\n\nFor k=0:\n(4 choose 0) * x^4 * (-1/x)^0 = 1 * x^4 * 1 = x^4\n\nFor k=1:\n(4 choose 1) * x^3 * (-1/x)^1 = 4 * x^3 * (-1/x) = 4 * x^3 * (-1/x) = -4x^2\n\nFor k=2:\n(4 choose 2) * x^2 * (-1/x)^2 = 6 * x^2 * (1/x^2) = 6 * x^2 * (1/x^2) = 6\n\nFor k=3:\n(4 choose 3) * x^1 * (-1/x)^3 = 4 * x * (-1/x^3) = 4 * x * (-1/x^3) = -4/x^2\n\nFor k=4:\n(4 choose 4) * x^0 * (-1/x)^4 = 1 * 1 * (1/x^4) = 1/x^4\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expansion is:\n\nx^4 - 4x^2 + 6 - 4/x^2 + 1/x^4\n\nNow, looking for the constant term, which is the term without x in it. That would be the term where the exponent of x is zero. In this case, the term is 6.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The term for k=2 is 6, which is indeed a constant. The other terms have x raised to some power, either positive or negative, so they are not constants.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in the expansion is 6.\n\nI think that's it. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in simplifying the original expression.\n\nWe started with (x - 1)^4 * (1 + 1/x)^4 and simplified it to (x - 1/x)^4. Expanding that gave us the terms x^4, -4x^2, 6, -4/x^2, and 1/x^4. The only constant term is 6, so that should be the answer.\n\nYeah, I feel confident about that. The constant term is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe constant term in the expansion of \\((x - 1)^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^4\\) is found by first simplifying the expression to \\((x - \\frac{1}{x})^4\\). Expanding this using the binomial theorem, we identify the constant term as 6.\n\n**Answer:** 6",

This happens when the powers of $x$ in the terms from both binomials add up to zero.

Here, we choose the second term from both binomials, which means we are looking for the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 4 trials:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Number of ways} &= C(4, 2) \\\\\n&= \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 1} \\\\\n&= 6.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNow, we multiply the constant term we found earlier by the number of ways these terms can be chosen:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boxed{\\text{Constant term in the expansion}} &= 1 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{6}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

        "reannotated_assistant_content": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a sequence {a_n} where all the terms are positive. The product of the first n terms is given as T_n. There's a point (T_n, n² - 15n) that lies on the graph of the function y = log₂x. I need to find the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence {log₂a_n}. The options are A: -140, B: -50, C: 124, D: 156.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the point (T_n, n² - 15n) is on the graph of y = log₂x. That means when x is T_n, y is n² - 15n. So, substituting into the function, we have:\n\nn² - 15n = log₂(T_n)\n\nWhich implies that T_n = 2^{n² - 15n}. Okay, so the product of the first n terms is 2 raised to the power of (n² - 15n). That makes sense.\n\nNow, since T_n is the product of the first n terms, a_n can be found by dividing T_n by T_{n-1}. So, a_n = T_n / T_{n-1}. Let me write that out:\n\na_n = T_n / T_{n-1} = 2^{n² - 15n} / 2^{(n-1)² - 15(n-1)}\n\nSimplifying the exponents, let's compute the exponent in the denominator:\n\n(n-1)² - 15(n-1) = (n² - 2n + 1) - 15n + 15 = n² - 17n + 16\n\nSo, the exponent in the numerator is n² - 15n, and in the denominator, it's n² - 17n + 16. Therefore, when we divide these, we subtract the exponents:\n\na_n = 2^{(n² - 15n) - (n² - 17n + 16)} = 2^{(n² - 15n - n² + 17n - 16)} = 2^{2n - 16}\n\nSo, a_n = 2^{2n - 16}. That simplifies to a_n = (2^{2n}) / (2^{16}) = (4^n) / (65536). But maybe it's better to keep it as 2^{2n - 16} for now.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence {log₂a_n}. So, let's find log₂a_n first.\n\nSince a_n = 2^{2n - 16}, taking log base 2 of both sides gives:\n\nlog₂a_n = 2n - 16\n\nSo, each term log₂a_n is equal to 2n - 16. Therefore, the sequence {log₂a_n} is an arithmetic sequence where each term is 2n - 16.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the first 10 terms of this sequence. Let's denote S as the sum:\n\nS = sum_{n=1}^{10} log₂a_n = sum_{n=1}^{10} (2n - 16)\n\nWe can split this sum into two separate sums:\n\nS = 2 * sum_{n=1}^{10} n - 16 * sum_{n=1}^{10} 1\n\nFirst, compute sum_{n=1}^{10} n. The formula for the sum of the first k integers is k(k + 1)/2. So here, k = 10:\n\nsum_{n=1}^{10} n = 10 * 11 / 2 = 55\n\nNext, compute sum_{n=1}^{10} 1. That's just adding 1 ten times, so it's 10.\n\nNow, plug these back into the expression for S:\n\nS = 2 * 55 - 16 * 10 = 110 - 160 = -50\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence {log₂a_n} is -50.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the point (T_n, n² - 15n) lying on y = log₂x, which gives T_n = 2^{n² - 15n}. Then, a_n = T_n / T_{n-1} = 2^{(n² - 15n) - ((n-1)² - 15(n-1))} = 2^{2n - 16}. Taking log₂ of a_n gives 2n - 16. Summing from n=1 to 10: sum(2n - 16) = 2*sum(n) - 16*sum(1) = 2*55 - 16*10 = 110 - 160 = -50. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's compute the first few terms of log₂a_n:\n\nFor n=1: 2(1) - 16 = -14\n\nFor n=2: 4 - 16 = -12\n\nFor n=3: 6 - 16 = -10\n\nFor n=4: 8 - 16 = -8\n\nFor n=5: 10 - 16 = -6\n\nFor n=6: 12 - 16 = -4\n\nFor n=7: 14 - 16 = -2\n\nFor n=8: 16 - 16 = 0\n\nFor n=9: 18 - 16 = 2\n\nFor n=10: 20 - 16 = 4\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n-14 + (-12) + (-10) + (-8) + (-6) + (-4) + (-2) + 0 + 2 + 4\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nStart with -14.\n\n-14 + (-12) = -26\n\n-26 + (-10) = -36\n\n-36 + (-8) = -44\n\n-44 + (-6) = -50\n\n-50 + (-4) = -54\n\n-54 + (-2) = -56\n\n-56 + 0 = -56\n\n-56 + 2 = -54\n\n-54 + 4 = -50\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me add them in pairs to make it easier:\n\nFirst pair: (-14) + (-12) = -26\n\nSecond pair: (-10) + (-8) = -18\n\nThird pair: (-6) + (-4) = -10\n\nFourth pair: (-2) + 0 = -2\n\nFifth pair: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nNow, add these results:\n\n-26 + (-18) = -44\n\n-44 + (-10) = -54\n\n-54 + (-2) = -56\n\n-56 + 6 = -50\n\nOkay, so that also gives -50. So, the sum is indeed -50. Therefore, the correct answer is B: -50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>\n\nGiven a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with all positive terms, the product of the first $n$ terms is $T_n$.

I need to evaluate q(p(x)) at several points: x = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then, I have to sum all these evaluated values. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but I think I can handle it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what q(p(x)) means. It's a composition of functions, right? So, q(p(x)) means I first apply p to x, and then apply q to the result of p(x). So, mathematically, that would be q(p(x)) = -|p(x)|. Since p(x) is |x| - 3, then q(p(x)) = -||x| - 3|. Okay, so it's the negative of the absolute value of (|x| - 3).
